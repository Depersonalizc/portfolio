                I ‚ù§Ô∏è clouds. That's why I built a real-time volumetric clouds renderer with my CS1230 teammates, based on 
                <a href="http://killzone.dl.playstation.net/killzone/horizonzerodawn/presentations/Siggraph15_Schneider_Real-Time_Volumetric_Cloudscapes_of_Horizon_Zero_Dawn.pdf">
                this</a> presentation at SIGGRAPH 2015. The renderer we developed with OpenGL and C++ supports intricate cloud <a href="#shape">shapes 
                generation</a>, realistic <a href="#lighting"> lighting effects</a>, and a physically-based <a href="#sky">sky</a> that varies throughout the day.
            </p>
        
            
            <a class="mono-link" href="#shape"><h2 id="shape">I. Shape</h2></a>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise">Worley noise</a> is a type of cellular noise where the value of each point 
                in space is determined by its distance to the closest neighbor in a set of random feature points. It is great for 
                modeling the density of clouds because when inverted, it tends to produce those nice bobbly patterns that resemble clouds.
            </p>

            <a class="mono-link" href="#optimizations"><h3 id="optimizations">Optimization</h3></a>
            <p>
                The first optimization we make of the above process is to take stratified samples of feature points in regular grid cells (let's call them
                grid points) instead of uniformly in space. 
                This reduces the quadratic number of candidate neighbors dramatically to 27 (constant!) in 3D since we can easily find the cell
                any point belongs. Here is an illustration for the 2D case as they're easier to draw.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/img/clouds/stratified.jpg"></img>
            <p>
                For even greater efficiency, we send the grid points to a compute shader, which calculates a 
                3D noise map with hundreds of GPU cores. Long live parallelism!
            </p>
            <a class="mono-link" href="#fractal-noise"><h3 id="fractal-noise">Fractal Noise</h3></a>
            <p>
                To create sufficient details for our clouds, we generate two sets of 3D Worley noise: a high resolution (200x200x200) one
                that controls the overall shape of the clouds, and a second lower resolution (64x64x64) one that adds details to the base
                shape by eroding lower-density regions of the shape texture. Each texture map has 4 channels of 3-layer Worley noise of 
                increasing frequency. This overlaying process generates <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/13/">fractal-like</a> noise 
                textures that add great details to our clouds. Below are slices of the four channels of our high resolution shape texture.

            <a class="mono-link" href="#tileable"><h3 id="tileable">Making it Tileable</h3></a>
            <p>
                One final pitfall of our previous scheme is that textures created that way are not tileable: visible seams occur when we place two copies of a
                texture next to each other. Luckily, there's a simple trick to fix that: wrap the grid points around the unit cube. This makes
                the grid points periodic and thus makes the noise texture tileable as well.
            </p>
    
            
            <a class="mono-link" href="#lighting"><h2 id="lighting">II. Lighting</h2></a>
            There are three key ingredients when it comes to realistic lighting for the clouds:
            <ul>
                <li>Beer's Law (exponential decay of light)</li>
                <li>Anistropic scattering (silver lining)</li>
                <li>Dark edges on clouds</li>
            </ul>
            <a class="mono-link" href="#observations"><h3 id="observations">Observations</h3></a>
            <ul>
                <li>All Users are able to quickly find the entry point (start button) of the interface.</li>
                <li>Most users hesitate about what do to next after customizing their drink on the Customization 
                    & Confirm page. Some toggle back and forth between the Menu and the Customization & Confirm page.</li>
                <li>Users seem unprepared when the machine suddenly pops out the cup and holds it in the air.</li>
                <li>Some users try to click on elements of the interface that are not interactive.</li>
            </ul>

            <a class="mono-link" href="#interview"><h3 id="interview">interview</h3></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Most users interviewed are using the coffee vending machine for the first time and aren't familiar 
                    with the purchasing process.</li>
                <li>Most users aren't sure what to expect with the coffee cup, regardless of their past experience. 
                    One user who had experience with a similar machine finds it surprising that the machine holds the 
                    cup in the air while filling it; another user with no previous experience doesn't know 
                    a cup will be provided.</li>
                <li>Some users find the logic of the checkout process to be counterintuitive; They expect a "Confirm" 
                    button before paying for the drink rather than the other way around.</li>
                <li>Some users find it cumbersome to order multiple items as separate orders, wishing a shopping cart 
                    functionality could be added that allows them to order everything in one go.</li>
                <li>Some users find the graphic illustration on the payment panel to be helpful.</li>
            </ul>
